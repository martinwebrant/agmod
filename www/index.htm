				<div class="bodyitem">
					<P>
					I thought it would be fun to play HL2 and code some on the <a href="http://www.adrenaline-gamer.com">Adrenaline Gamer 2</a> mod, but it just wasn't - so I stepped down from coding just after Christmas.<br>
					The team got my old sourcecode and a hotline if they have questions.<br><p>

					CHiNX is putting together a team to make <a href="http://www.adrenaline-gamer.com">Adrenaline Gamer 2</a> for the new Source engine.<br />
					I signed up to get the code started and setup the basic match functions that we got in AG today. Beyond that is up the rest of the team.<br />
					I'm sure this will be bring the community together once again since there are no deathmatch shipped in HL2.<br />

				<h3>Spyware & Virus</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<P>
					There have been a lot of new players coming on since AG was featured in the Steam game browser.
					<br>
					Welcome, and dont be alarmed of the skill of the existing AG players, we are the cream of the crop of HLDM :)
					<br>
					<br>
					Rich (the guy that runs the cheat logger in <A href="irc://irc.quakenet.org/aghl">#aghl@irc.quakenet.org</A>) wanted me to tell you guys that you really need to scan for spyware and adware. There has been a lof ot players "caught" by AG's cheat detection that is caused by infected system.
					<br>
					Please install and run Adaware from <a href="http://www.lavasoftusa.com/">Lavasoft</a> or Spybot S&D from <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org">Safe Networking</A> to get rid of the spyware.<br>
					While you are at it get AVG Free edition from <a href="http://www.grisoft.com">Grisoft</a> to remove the viruses. 
					<br>
					<br>
					There has been 1054 downloads on one mirror today so I added a few more to take the load off.
					<br>
					If you want to join a clan for some fun games then post in the General forum at <a href="http://www.hlccl.com/forums/">www.hlccl.com</a>.
					<br>
					One other good things to know is that most American servers uses efilflah (halflife backwords) as password and most European uses hlclan. Why? Cause the server is cheaper with pass on :)
					<br>
					<br>Good luck and have fun at the servers with a CLEAN and healthy computer!

					<P>
						This is just a small update on the server side part of AG 6.5 + a new skin by 
						alba for <a href="http://www.pro-hl.com/steam.shtml">Steam</a><br>
						The installer should now also detect the correct Steam dir. If not, then run 
						Half-Life once from the Steam menu.<br>
						<br>
					This will be last version of AG so I would like say thank you to:<p>
					Saturn48, Mr. T-rex, Golem, Raz, Hicks, AweX, Don,Tolon, Spr, Scary-one, Reno, 
					Wolf, Violation, CHiNX, Finger, SmelC, KungFuSquirrel, Cash Car Star and Valve

				<h3>AG Steam</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<P>
						Here is a version of AG that can be used on the Steam platform.<br>
						<br>
						Note:<br>
						1. Installer does not detect Steam directory so select 
						Steam\SteamApps\your@email.com\Half-Life manually.<br>
						2. When I cleaned up startup_server.cfg I accidently removed sv_maxspeed 300 - 
						so add that back into it. If you dont you might end up with speed 270 or 320.<br>
						3. This release go into Half-Life\AG folder.<br>
						4. I'll wait for Valve to release a proper Steam SDK with VAC support before I 
						release the real "easy to install", "spiced up" Steam version (No ETA).
						<br>
						<br>
						I saw a good column at <a href="http://www.esreality.com/?a=post&amp;id=476754">ESReality.com</a>
						about HLDM and AG. Check it out, it's fun to see the Quake players comments!

				<h3>Steam problems</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>
						Seems like any mod that is not made or maintained by Valve crashes in 
						GameUI.dll when starting a listen server in Steam. I'll try to contact Valve 
						after the weekend and figure it out.<br>
						I noticed some other serious problems when using the x.1.1.1 dedicated server 
						or steam - one of their functions changed it's returnvalue breaking a lot of my 
						code.<br>
						Thankfully that was an easy serverside fix for Windows/Linux here: <a href="http://www.gaming4nothing.de/aghl/ag_64beta.zip">
							ag_64beta.zip</a>.
						<br>
						I recommend that you wait for the real HL patch that merges with Steam before 
						you update your servers/computers. That will give us modmakers enough headroom 
						to update our mods so they work properly.
						<br>
						<br>
						Now some good news!<br>
						I also fixed AG minimod to work in Steam and with the x.1.1.1 dedicated server. 
						Get it here - <a href="http://www.gaming4nothing.de/aghl/ag_64mini.zip">ag_64mini.zip</a>.<br>
						The minimod is a small Valve replacement with the standard commands and 
						gamemodes except CTF/DOM. It got bunnyjumping, but it's still locked on the 
						client so it doesn't feel as smooth as regular AG.<br>
						<br>
						If you are using my Gamebrowser then you can change to the new Steam master 
						server in the settings dialog (get there with Commands-Configure). The new one 
						is hlmaster1.hlauth.net.

				<h3>Adrenaline Gamer 6.3</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>The 6.1 and 6.2 version didn't work well with Counter-Strike retail version. 
						Players got wrongfully kicked by the cheat detection rutines I wrote.
						<br>
						I'm sorry about that and I've now fixed that and the problems with 
						German/French versions of Half-Life aswell.
						<br>
						I hope that the community will try out the betas I make available before the 
						releases better next time to avoid these kinds of problems.
						<br>
						<br>
						Note that <a href="http://www.asus.com.tw">ASUS</a> still ship their drivers 
						with built in wallhack/wireframe mode. So you cant use their drivers with AG 
						Mod until they remove it. Regular drivers from <a href="http://www.nvidia.com">nVidia</a>
						and other suppliers work fine.<br>
						So change to <a href="http://www.nvidia.com">nVidia</a> drivers if you get 
						caught by the AG Mod cheat check indicating a bad nvoglnt dll.
						<br>
						<br>
						<B>Added features:</B>
						<br>
						Added 3 new CTF maps, agctf_forsaken and agctf_echo by ReNo and agctf_daydream 
						by Cash Car Star
						<br>
						Added Capture The Flag II gamemode. It's a mix between Last Team Standing and 
						CTF
						<br>
						Added Domination gamemode. This is a gamemode that [*mup*]Hicks been working 
						on. There are a bit more work to be done here, but you can play it on datacore 
						so far!
						<br>
						Added hud_color and fixed con_color on request from Tolon
						<br>
						Added agnextmode to change mode when the map changes
						<br>
						Added empty agallow statement to vote for yourself
						<br>
						Added sv_ag_allow_timeout 0/1 to be able to turn off timeout on the server
						<br>
						Added play_close to play a wav file to team m8's close of you. At the same time 
						I changed play_team to play to all team m8's
						<br>
						Added so that satchels can teleport. With this there is a little chance of 
						blowing up mines set close to the teleport. But it won't get the ones a further 
						away.
						<br>
						Added agrecord to be able to record to a unique filename without using aliases.
						<br>
						Added some overview images for popular maps made by <A href="mailto:stig@stig3d.com">
							Stig</A> and <A href="mailto:jugger1@blueyonder.co.uk">Jugger</A>.
						<br>
						<br>
						<B>Bugfixes:</B>
						<br>
						Modelcheck now works properly
						<br>
						Fixed black text when using no colors
						<br>
						Fixed problems with the storm dudes names
						<br>
						You can use ^ in text now
						<br>
						Fixed two egon beams in specmode
						<br>
						Fixed egon beam left on screen when you specced someone using a beam and you 
						left specmode
						<br>
						Fixed annoying bug when a players grens, satchels where invisible in specmode
						<br>
						Fixed restore score in lan games (based it on IP address)
						<br>
						Fixed sound and position problems in spectator mode - still not fixed in HLTV
						<br>
						I removed damage on the rpg and grenades left in air when the map is reset 
						(problem with lamers in arena/lts/lms mode)
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Other changes:</b>
						<br>
						Updated cheat protection. It will now use less memory in the server (wont 
						precache the halflife.wad etc).
						<br>
						Note - that liquids.wad, halflife.wad and gfx.wad is added to cheat check. So 
						dont change them.
						<br>
						Also not that you can change blue/red models as you whish. Just dont make em 
						bigger than the standard models.
						<br>
						The cheat protection is turned off in LAN servers cause it's just annoying to 
						wait there.
						<br>
						Changed url to loadauthid. It now accepts any web address, but you cant load 
						any other local file than realnames.txt
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>I want to say special thank you to:</b>
						<br>
						<A href="mailto:jrisan@online.no">Urge</A> for helping out with Linux machine

				<h3>AG5.3 Released!</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p><b>This update is for players and server admins. </b>
						<br>
						<i>You cant connect to older servers with this patch and vice versa.</i>
						<br>
						<br>
						<B>Added features:</B>
						<BR>
						Cheat updates is now as easy as downloading a <A href="cheats/cheats.dat">cheats.dat</A>
						file from this page and put it in the AG directory on the server. This makes it 
						easy for me and for server admins to keep up to date with the latest game 
						destroyers. The cheat check is also much faster. The current <A href="cheats/cheats.dat">
							cheats.dat</A> file adds protection from the speedhack released today.
						<br>
						If you wanna enjoy a game vs <a href="http://www.gamershomepage.com/rhobot/">Rho-bot's</a>
						you can now add them from a lan game with the command "addbot"
						<br>
						Thx to <A href="mailto:rhobot@gamershomepage.com">Scott</A> for making the 
						Rho-Bot sourcecode public for everyone to use.
						<br>
						I have also added a bunch of server variables to make AG more configurable. 
						Check them out in the help pages.
						<br>
						<br>
						<B>Bugfixes:</B>
						<br>
						Complete HLTV scoreboard fix as promised before.
						<BR>
						Added the latest bugfixes from valve with soundfix for crossbow, zoomfix for 
						python and egon gun fixes.
						<BR>
						And some other bugs that I forgot to write down.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Other news</b>
						<br>
						<a href="http://www.barrysworld.com">Barrysworld</a> is now using AG 5 on their 
						servers for the <a href="http://www.hlccl.com">HLCCL</a> leage. They host 6 
						servers for the 48 clans in 6 divisions so they can enjoying a good game each 
						Sunday evening!

				<h3>AG 5.01 Released!</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>I've compiled a server update to fix a few of the problems with the latest 
						release.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Added features:</B>
						<BR>
						Added gamemode TDM4 with friendlyfire on, weaponstay off, wallgauss off and 
						pure settings for the Nations CUP '2001 on <a href="http://www.clanbase.com">http://www.clanbase.com</a>.
						<BR>
						Documented the IRC feature.
						<BR>
						Added a simple guide to HLTV.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						<B>Bugfixes:</B>
						<BR>
						Spectators are now on their own team.
						<BR>
						HLTV clients now get the full scoreboard sent on agstart. If a client connects 
						later his scoreboard wont be displayed as teamplay. A clientside fix will be 
						issued later to fully fix the problem.
						<BR>
						Merging of RPG code went a bit bad so the rocket had the double velocity... I 
						fixed that.
						<BR>
						agstart now correctly restore how much hev refillers charge. Accidently filled 
						it up to the same value as health refillers.
						<BR>
						Tried to fix scoreboard for demos a bit better. I now resend the complete 
						team/player list 5 seconds after the demo started.
						<BR>
						Admins can now change the gamemode.
						<BR>
						<BR>
						I recommend that all server admins download this so that AG5 can be used the 
						the Nations CUP.
