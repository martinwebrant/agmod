Title:			DyCe
File name:		dyce.bsp
Author:			Martin Buff a.k.a. "Violation"
E-mail:			v.c.assasin@btinternet.com
Background:		The year is 2000+ something, this bright chap called Derik finds that he
			has no room to keep his pet snails anymore, so he builds this arena (yes on his own)
			but before he can place his snails in the arena some big 'ard men come in and 
			beat him till he dies. They cant decide who 0wnz the snail arena so they 
			fight for it. So if you want the arena for your own you have to fight for it.
			eehh i named it Dyce cos the old man that made hit for his snails was called
			Derik Dyce... no i didnt just make all this up!

Players:		As many as you want, but its a 1v1 map

Information:		This is my first 1v1 map, and it shows i think, r_speeds are pretty pants in

			should play fine. There are a few rebounds, but nearly all maps have a few...
			i got rid of alot of them however.

Special Thanks:		-Valve for making the best fps of all-time.
