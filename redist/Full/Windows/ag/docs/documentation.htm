				<h3>Why I made this mod</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>
						<b></b>
						<br>
						The Adrenaline Gamer MOD was first targeted as an easy server side replacement 
						for the Half-Life Deathmatch clans.<br>
						But now it's targeted for all players that want a better Half-Life Deathmatch 
						experience.<br>
						It got cheat protection, spectator mode, new game modes and match features.<br>
						<br>
						I'll try to explain all the features of the Adrenaline Gamer MOD.<br>
						I'll start off with the most used ones and I'll end with tellin you how the 
						advanced commands work.<br>
						<br>

				<h3>After install</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>
						The installer automaticly copies your config.cfg and autoexec.cfg from previous 
						version of AG/HLDM. I recommend that you bind the commandmenu when you first 
						run the mod. You can do this with the Half-Life menus or by adding this line: <BLOCKQUOTE>bind 
							"M" "+commandmenu"</BLOCKQUOTE>
					to your config.cfg in the C:/Half-Life/AG directory. With the commandmenu you 
					can enter spectator mode, call votes to change map or gamemodes. You got 
					everything you need in there.
					<P></P>

				<a name="Match functions"></a>
				<h3>Match functions</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>
						If you play clanmatches you can add the teamplay binds aswell.<br>
						I'll start of with the simple say bind that say:
						<br>
						"It's me" and adds your health(%H) and armour(%A) status to text.<br>
						<BLOCKQUOTE> bind "I" "say_team It's me! %H/%A"</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<br>
						You can enhance it abit more and add the location(%L) where you are
						<br>
						(works only on standard and the AG map packs).<br>
						<BLOCKQUOTE> bind "I" "say_team It's me! %H/%A - I'm at %L"</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<br>
						And for fun you can add a sound to it that gets played on team mates that
						<br>
						are close to you.<br>
						<BLOCKQUOTE> bind "N" "say_team It's me! %H/%A - I'm at %L;play_team 
							barney/hellonicesuit.wav" </BLOCKQUOTE>
						<br>
						You can find more sounds to use by downloading a pakviewer and open
						<br>
						up the C:/Half-Life/valve/pak0.pak file.<br>
						<br>
						A good bind that is needed in matches is the drop bind. It drops your current
						<br>
						weapon to your team m8 and say's what weapon you dropped.<br>
						<BLOCKQUOTE> bind "G" "say_team Dropped weapon %W;drop"</BLOCKQUOTE>
						<br>
						Thats it for the binds. Wasn't so hard was it? ;)<br>
						<br>
						I'll go on to explain the match features.
						<br>
						A match is started with the agstart command. You can find this by using the 
						command menu.<br>
						The agstart command will start a countdown (if the vote is accepted).
						<br>
						The timelimit and frags will be reset after the countdown and the players are 
						respawned.<br>
						<br>
						If you are the admin of the game you should be in spectator mode when the match 
						starts. After the match begins the players are fixed.
						<br>
						If a new player enters the server he will put into spectator mode for the 
						remaining time of the match. If a player drops from the server during the match 
						he will be let back into the game when he joins again.<br>
						A timeout (60 second pause) can be called at any time during the match and a 
						drop is good sitution to call that. A team only got one timeout per match so 
						use it carefully.<br>
						<br>
						If a team needs to replace a player during the match they can use the agallow 
						command to let a spectator in. This console command works like this:<br>
						agallow "player name" (example: agallow [pmers]BulliT)<br>
						It can also be used with the player id from the status command like this:<br>
						agallow "player id" (example: agallow #43)<br>
						<br>
					<P></P>
				</div>
				<a name="Changing gamemode"></a>
				<h3>Changing gamemode</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>
						You can change gamemode with the commandmenu<br>
						Here is an explaination of the current AG gamemodes:<br>
						<br>
						<u>Free For All</u>: This is the standard Deathmatch server.<br>
						<br>
						<u>Team Deathmatch</u>: This gamemode could vary from server to server.
						<br>
						A fresh install set this to be the www.clanbase.com CUP settings.
						<br>
						The CUP settings are accepted as the European standard.<br>
						<br>
						<u>CTF</u>: Capture The Flag mode, a fun teamplay mode where you try to capture 
						the opponents flag.<br>
						Score system:<br>
						4 points for each capture.<br>
						1 point for returning your teams flag.<br>
						1 point for killing the opponent that carries your flag.<br>
						1 point for stealing the other teams flag.<br>
						1 point if you kill your opponent while defending your flag.<br>
						<br>
						<u>LMS</u>: Last Man Standing wins!
						<br>
						You start with a subset of the standard weapons and battle it out until one man 
						remains!
						<br>
						<br>
						<u>LTS</u>: Last Team Standing wins!
						<br>
						You start with a subset of the standard weapons and battle it out until one 
						team remains!
						<br>
						<br>
						<u>Arena</u>: The one on one mode. When a player dies he goes to spectator mode
						<br>
						and the next in line is spawned after a countdown. If you just want to
						<br>
						watch you can change your ready status in the commandmenu
						<br>
						(ready/notready). Settings may vary from server to server.
						<br>
						<br>
						<u>Arcade</u>: Warmup mode to get the feel for the weapons before a match. You
						<br>
						allways spawn with all weapons and ammo. If you kill someone you get a refill
						<br>
						as a reward. It got reduced headshot and less damage radius just like the
						<br>
						match mode.<br>
						<br>
						<u>Sgbow</u>: Shotgun and bow mode, this mode features a subset of the regular 
						weapons and is alot of fun, it got reduced headshots and a gauss to jump with 
						(gauss wont do any damage).
						<br>
						<br>
						<u>Instagib</u>: One shot one kill!

					<p>
						Download the latest dedicated server for Windows <a href="http://www.daddeln.de/index.php?s=&section=filedb&action=details&file_id=19426">
							hlserver4110.exe</a>
						<br>
						or the latest for Linux <a href="http://www.daddeln.de/index.php?s=&section=filedb&action=details&file_id=23658">
							hlds_l_3110_full.bin</a>
						<br>
						If my links don't work go to <a href="http://www.fileplanet.com">Fileplanet</a> 
						and download the file there.
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Special Linux instructions in italic:</b>
						<br>
						<I>Download the file to your home directory, then type:
							<br>
							tar xfzv hlds_l3110.tar.gz
							<br>
							cd hlds_l
							<br>
							<br>
							Then download AG to the hlds_l directory you currently
							<br>
							are standing in, then type:
							<br>
							tar xfzv ag_63.tar.gz
							<br>
							cd aghl
							<br>
							<br>
							Then edit "ag_run" and change port if you have more servers
							<br>
							running on the machine. You start the linux server with ag_run command
							<br>
							when you are done with the settings below.
							<br>
							<br>
						</I>After you installed it you need to edit the /aghl/server.cfg and change:
						<br>
						rcon_password - Remote control password.
						<br>
						hostname - The name to show in a gamebrowser.
						<br>
						sv_password - The password to enter the server.
						<br>
						sv_contact - Your email address.
						<br>
						<br>
						You can also go into startup_server.cfg and change to what
						<br>
						gamemode the server will start in.
						<br>
						sv_ag_gamemode ffa - Free For All
						<br>
						sv_ag_gamemode tdm - Team Deathmatch
						<br>
						sv_ag_gamemode arena - Arena
						<br>
						sv_ag_gamemode arcade - Arcade

						You can also change the allowed gamemodes. For all gamemodes use blank string.
						<br>
						You can also use this string here with all gamemodes allowed. Remove those you 
						dont like.
						<br>
						I recommend that you leave it to what the installer set for you.
						<br>
						sv_ag_allowed_gamemodes 
						"ffa;ffax;tdm;tdm2;tdm3;tdmx;arena;arcade;sgbow;instagib;ctf;lts;lms"
						<br>
						<br>
						Do not change mp_xxx server settings in server.cfg. Add/Change them in
						<br>
						the gamemodes configuration files in /aghl/gamemodes. I repeat - do not change 
						mp_xxx server settings in server.cfg!
						<br>
						<br>
						You can easily start a Windows server by using the shortcuts in startmeny. I 
						predefined a standard internet and a standard LAN server.
						<br>
						Please dont use server password if you dont need to, we need to help new 
						players into the game!
						<br>
						If your server admin demands a password then please use hlclan and remember to 
						set sv_contact so I can contact you!

				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>
						ircconnect - Connect to IRC server.<BR>
						ircdisconnect - Disconnect from IRC server.<BR>
						irc - Execute IRC commands.<BR>
						toggleirc - Brings up a VGUI dialog that can be used to chat. BR&gt;
						<BR>
						To overide the default parameters I added a few variables.<BR>
						irc_server - The server you want to connect to. Defaults to 
						irc.quakenet.eu.org.<BR>
						irc_port - The port on the server. Defaults to 6667.<BR>
						irc_nick - The nick on IRC. If this is empty it uses your Half-Life name.<BR>
						<BR>
						For other networks than quakenet:<BR>
						irc_userid - Userid on server. If this is empty it uses your computername.<BR>
						irc_password - Password on server. No defaults on this one.<BR>
						irc_fullname - Fullname on server. If empty it uses the username you logged on 
						in windows.<BR>
						irc_autojoin - Channel you want to join upon connect. Standard is #pmers<BR>
						<BR>
						Use / before the IRC commands.
						<BR>
						Leave the / out if you want to send messages.<BR>
						To send private messages write /privmsg nick message
						<BR>
						That will send the text "message" to the nick "nick".<BR>
						<BR>
						Example:<BR>
						ircconnect<BR>
						irc /join #pmers<BR>
						irc hey boys!<BR>
						irc /privmsg Bullster man this r0x!<BR>
						ircdisconnect<BR>
						<BR>
						Known problems:<BR>
						Key input is messed up in VGUI dialog until Valve bugfix the VGUI code.<BR>
						Nick changes aren't saved on your client so you might see the old nick you had 
						before you changed it - but others see the new one.<BR>
						Zonealarm brings up a dialog during connect causing Half-Life to hang.<BR>
						<BR>
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>HLTV</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>
						<a name="HLTV"></a>HLTV is a seperate application runned by server admins or by 
						helpful players.<BR>
						It works like a server for players so they connect to HLTV instead of the real 
						server.<BR>
						Example:<BR>
						Galzac (a cool dude with fat pipe :P) starts a HLTV server in Sweden and 
						connects to GIB #1 server in Italy.<BR>
						The server in Italy will then get a player named HLTV_Proxy. The proxy is 
						flagged as a spectator and wont join the game.<BR>
						If you for example are using the excellent <A href="http://www.udpsoft.com/eye/">All 
							Seeing Eye</A> you will notice that there are two servers now.<BR>
						GIB #1 HLICUP<BR>
						GIB #1 HLICUP:0<BR>
						The one with the number is the HLTV proxy that Galzac put up and the one 
						without is the real server in Italy.<BR>
						Players that wanna watch the game connect to Galzac instead of the real server.<BR>
						That way they 20+ players can spectate the game instead of just the few that 
						can join the real server.<BR>
						The best thing is that there dont have to be anyone but the players and the 
						HLTV proxy on the real server. So they get a lagg free game.<BR>
						For big games it could be good to make a chain of HLTV servers.<BR>
						The ones that got a good enough connection to run HLTV decide that one connect 
						to the server. He then puts password on his server so that no one can get in 
						except the others that want to run HLTV.<BR>
						That is done so that he first server dont get borked down by alot of players 
						that want to spectate the game. They will instead connect to the other HLTV's. 
						That ensures that the main connect to the real server is good and lagg free.<BR>
						I made a little picture <a href="images/hltv.gif">here</a> to explain it.<BR>
					<p>
						For the primary HLTV server I recommend that you use a shortcut like this:<BR>
						c:\sierra\half-life\hltv.exe -maxclients 8 +password "primarypass"<BR>
						When started just type "connect yyy:27015" where the ip is the HL server.<BR>
						For the secondary line of HLTV servers I recommend that you use this shortcut:<BR>
						c:\sierra\half-life\hltv.exe -maxclients 32
						<BR>
						When started just type "connect xxx:27020" where the ip is the primary HLTV 
						server.<BR>
						<BR>
					</p>
				</div>
				<h3>Metamod</h3>
				<div class="bodyitem">
					<p>
						<a name="Metamod"></a>If you are using <a href="http://www.metamod.org">Metamod</a>
						you need to update it to v1.13.1 be able to host AG CTF games.
						<br>
						You also have to rename AG.DLL(ag_i386.so) to HL.DLL(hl_i386.so) to get metamod 
						to work, Will (metamod dude) forgot to change it.
